# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a website that allows users to generate random romcom movie covers, save them, and create their own! If someone is interested in browsing randomly generated covers, they have come to the right place!

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Simply fork and clone our repo and you can run the site on your local machine.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had about 5 days to work on the project. It started mid week 2 of Mod 1 and was due by the end of weekend.
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Learning goals were getting experience manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. We were provided with the HTML and CSS but only wrote code in the JS file. All of the functionality and changes to the displayed data was done in JS.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One big challenge was figuring out ways to add elements without using innerHTML. Asking for help and learning about append() method and createElement was a great help. A big win was using helper functions to help clean up the different page views. Being able to repurpose functions to quickly add and remove buttons and views was really nice for the code quality!
